# Browser Support
{: .no_toc }

Code will be compiled down to ES5 with support for browsers futher back but compatibility may vary for you. We currently support:

1. Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Safari
4. Edge
5. Safari (iOS)
6. IE 11

**NOTE:** Be aware that IE 11 support will be removed in the very near future. All modern browsers are based on the previous 2 releases but support may extend beyond these.

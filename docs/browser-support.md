# Browser Support
{: .no_toc }

While this package doesn't explicitly have support for specific browsers we try to maintain a zero-configuration approach that enables tools such as Babel to build ES5 compatible outputs without the need for additional configuration.

Please refer to the [.browserslistrc](https://github.com/aem-design/aemdesign-aem-support/blob/master/aemdesign-aem-compose/.browserslistrc) in the AEM.Design Compose project which supports:

1. Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Safari
4. Edge
5. IE 11
6. Safari (iOS 9+)
7. Android 4.4+
